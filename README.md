# morning_website
A website to display information I want for my morning commute

HOW TO USE:

This website requires an API key from https://developer.forecast.io/

afterwards, create a file called strings.json and add the following:
{
    "apiKey":"YOUR_KEY_HERE"
}

This will get the weather for your account there.
